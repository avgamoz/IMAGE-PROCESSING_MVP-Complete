# IMAGE-PROCESSING_MVP-Complete

## Project Name:  
      IMAGE-PROCESSING APP

## Introduction: 
      The project is all about the ability to predict the look of every situation whether ugly, happy or sad. I used python as a backend to               implement the intention. The future update will be to add frontend to the project so as to complement the work.
